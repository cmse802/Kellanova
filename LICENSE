Standard Non-Disclosure Agreement
This document sets forth my rights and responsibilities regarding the non-disclosure of 
confidential information that I obtain through my participation in CMSE495 “Experiential 
Learning in Data Science,” under the direction of Dr. Dirk Colbry, Computational Mathematics, 
Science and Engineering, at Michigan State University with a project for Kellanova (hereafter 
“COMPANY”) with offices located at 1 Kellogg Sq, Battle Creek, MI 49017 titled “Capstone”
(hereafter “PROJECT”). I understand this document is an agreement for the non-disclosure of 
confidential information and is a binding legal agreement between COMPANY and myself, Alan 
Leon (hereafter “STUDENT”), with a home address at 1326 Hartland Dr., Troy, MI. STUDENT 
understands they have the right to seek independent legal advice at their own expense prior to 
signing this agreement.
Non-Disclosure Obligations
COMPANY possesses and considers to be proprietary and confidential certain information, 
drawings, data, software, documentation, business plans and know-how relating to technology 
owned by COMPANY (all such confidential information, drawings, data, software, documentation, 
business plans and know-how are hereinafter referred to as “CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION”). It 
is understood that STUDENT and COMPANY are both interested in having STUDENT receive 
access to such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for the sole purpose of working on PROJECT. 
Because such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION is proprietary and confidential to COMPANY, and to 
provide an appropriate basis by which such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION can be made available 
to STUDENT, the parties agree to the following terms and provisions:
1. STUDENT will treat as confidential, and not disclose to any other person outside of COURSE or 
COMPANY, all CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which is or has been made available, directly or 
indirectly, to STUDENT, and will treat it with the same degree of care that it would treat 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION of its own.
2. STUDENT agrees to only use CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for PROJECT and not for any 
other purpose, whether commercial or non-commercial.
3. STUDENT agrees not to make any copies of CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION unless STUDENT 
has written permission from COMPANY.
4. The non-disclosure obligations of STUDENT under this agreement do not apply to 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which: (a) at the time of the disclosure is generally available 
to the public or thereafter becomes generally available to the public through no act or 
omission of STUDENT; or (b) STUDENT can show by written records to have been in 
STUDENT’s possession prior to the time of the disclosure and was not acquired, directly or 
indirectly, from COMPANY; or (c) STUDENT can show by written records to have been 
independently made available as a matter of right to STUDENT by others, provided such others 
did not acquire CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION directly or indirectly from COMPANY.
Furthermore, STUDENT may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to an order of a court 
or governmental agency, provided that STUDENT first uses reasonable efforts to provide 
COMPANY with advance notice to permit COMPANY to seek a protective order or otherwise 
restrict the disclosure of the Confidential Information.

5. STUDENT shall return all materials, drawings, data, memoranda, and written information in 
STUDENT’s possession relating to such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, including copies 
thereof, to COMPANY, either upon request by COMPANY or at the completion of PROJECT.
6. Nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed to grant to STUDENT any rights in 
respect of such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION other than for stated PROJECT.
General Terms
The parties agree that any xerographically or electronically reproduced copy of this fully-executed 
agreement shall have the same legal force and effect as any copy bearing original signatures of the 
parties. This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the 
subject matter thereof.
STUDENT understands they are not required to participate in PROJECT, but if they do so, then the 
terms of this agreement apply.
STUDENT’s obligations and responsibilities under this agreement will continue after completion 
of PROJECT and/or conclusion of their involvement with PROJECT.
This agreement is effective upon the latest date of signature
